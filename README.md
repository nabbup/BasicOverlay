# Raine's Basic Overlay for Sonic 3 AIR
a framework-ish type thing where it displays a sprite on the screen at all times, used here to recreate the way colors look in Retro Engine ports of the Genesis Sonic games, and the 1997-ish PC rereleases of Sonic CD and Sonic & Knuckles Collection.
it can really be used for whatever if you know how to do it right. functions are included in the top of the scripts to help with people who wish to make their own overlay.
